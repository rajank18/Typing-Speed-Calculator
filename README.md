# Typing Speed Test Application
This is a Typing Speed Test application built in Java, where users can measure their typing speed (Words Per Minute - WPM) by typing sentences of different difficulty levels. The project uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction and stores users' results in an Oracle Database.

## All the files are in the master branch

## Features
User Authentication: Users can register and log in with their credentials.
Typing Test: Users can take a typing test by selecting a sentence difficulty level:
Short
Medium
Long

## Typing Speed Calculation: The application calculates the WPM based on the user's input and time taken.
Database Integration: User test results are stored in an Oracle Database for future reference.
Results Display: The WPM score is displayed at the end of each test.

## Technologies Used
Java: Core language used to build the application.
Swing: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
JDBC: For database connectivity to Oracle.
Oracle Database: To store user data and test results.
